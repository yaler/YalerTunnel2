YalerTunnel - generic tunneling via the Yaler relay infrastructure

Copyright (c) 2013, Yaler GmbH, Switzerland. All rights reserved.

YalerTunnel makes any service (e.g. a Web server or a SSH daemon) accessible
from the Internet, no matter if the service is behind a firewall, a NAT, or a
mobile network gateway.

If the service is based on HTTP, YalerTunnel is started in server mode,
otherwise in proxy mode. The client either knows HTTP (e.g. a Web browser),
supports HTTP proxies (e.g. PuTTY), or uses a second instance of YalerTunnel
started in client mode to access the tunneled service.
